So we booked our tickets for March 2017. While traveling we discovered lots of handmade items, talented craftsman & woodworkers and the work they have been doing was amazing. Me & my biz partner saw an opportunity in the market and wanted to capitalize on it. These artisans are hard workers but their talent is not paid well and they are not exposed to the international market, so there you go that is how CraftsNinja was born."],["So after attending our mastermind & networking sessions, we decided to stay a bit longer to research some great product ideas and design a prototype and test it out on Facebook."],["After a week of research, we were finally onto some designs and some great product ideas. We decided to turn them from paper into reality, so we hired 3 artisans for this job. We gave them instructions, designs and let them do their job. After 2 days we were contacted by them and now we had our prototypes. The reason we wanted 3 prototypes from 3 different artisans was to see the quality difference between the 3. We decided to go with only 1 out of 3 ( in handmade the quality is what matters). We wanted to WOW our customers as their first impression."],["Now it was time to do a photoshoot and take some operational videos for our social media test. We had our CANON 70D complete kit so we decided to take some crisp clear pictures and send them to our designer for quick edit. After 2 hours we were ready to create and launch our first Facebook ads test campaign."],["My biz partner who takes care of all the marketing, growth & conversion strategies decided to test it out to 4 big countries US,UK,CA,AU with $50 ad budget. He scheduled the new campaign for next day midnight. We were so excited to the results. The campaign went live after few hours, here goes our first sale after 2 hours, followed by the second and third! we jumped out from our chairs like crazy we knew we got the next big thing!! The day ended up with 12 sales making us little over $500 in revenue which was INSANE. Our first test campaign on the very first day without any optimization was sitting at 1000x ROI. People were liking, commenting & sharing like CRAZY, this shows how passionate this niche is once you have a quality product."],["As the excitement was on peak, we didn't pause our campaign but we let it run instead without thinking that we didn't had any inventory to ship that time. So I quickly went to the product listing and wrote down that this particular handmade item is a PRE ORDER and shipping takes anywhere from 5 to 10 days but this didnt stop people from buying it. After a week of running the campaign, we had over 100 orders that need to be fulfilled and shipped ASAP, so we slowed down the ads to work on our manufacturing and logistics first. We hired 3 more artisans to work on pending orders and then ship them via DHL so customers get it on time, Although customers do understand that handmade items do take some time to ship them."],["We initially started our test run on our existing store because we wanted to test out fast rather than developing a site which takes around 2-3 weeks for a branded site like CraftsNinja and we did good numbers on that and later on after a few weeks once we had setup our manufacturing and logistics process, we launched CraftsNinja ( the brand you will be buying and as a BONUS we will include the other one as well, more on that later)."],["We also sell some of our items on Amazon FBA and the ROI is crazy, we have got BEST SELLING TAG for one of our products."],["We use a fulfilment service to fulfill all our orders.

So all the marketing operations were halted by my partner and now we want to raise money for his medical expenses by selling our baby which we regret but we have no other options as the medical bills are piling up every single day, in addition we want to see our baby grow and want someone to take care of it because the potential in this niche is unlimited.

Do you drop ship or hold the inventory yourself?\nWhat work have you already put into creating the business?\nThe store started as dropshipping in early July-October 2017. Due to the success we started providing higher quality items straight from our manufacturer. Our Warehouse in Midlands UK receives the stock as inventory is tracked aswell, which he then sends it packaged accordingly with our branded logo and giving it a special treat, then it arrives to our customer. The shipping is quiet fast max 15 days internationally as service used is Royal Mail or DHL according to customer choice.\nThere is still around 500 branded packaging with our manufacturer in Hong Kong which he can ship out items once you buy the store. They will indeed package as we agreed with them just before we moved to the warehouse in the UK. The only drawback to that is long waiting times of up to 20 days for delivery. However the new owner should set up their own warehouse relationship, as our warehouse contract is not included in the sell but the inventory is. What we can do is connect them to an easy setup warehouse near to them or even our warehouse company."],["What have you done to attract customers? Here you can describe your store's marketing strategies ie. advertising campaigns, relationships with social media influencers, or successful email campaigns.\nWe attracted customers mainly from social media advertising (fb ads), however we have indeed done one influencers campaign with an influencer with 10K Followers which resulted in a professional video and few sales here and there."],["New owner should use our 25K mailing lists more regularly as we barely do except for abandoned carts\/orders. We also suggest to hire a Google Adsense freelancers (100-150$\/m) to advertising more on Google Adsense for organic traffic while implementing a better SEO. \nOur next strategy if we were not to sell the store it will be influencer marketing, we have an offer from an agency which owns 6\/7 top pages with 1 million followers minimum each for a 24 hours post for $500 for all the pages. Such type of posting is good, however we would still recommend contacting influencers to advertise products which they don't require any monetary value but more of a product to them for free which is usually a better return on investment. as if it's not successfully then you end up with well taken pictures with our packaging and jewelry."],["What is your cost of customer acquisition?\nFB Advertising customer acquisition average in $20 but this can go as low as $11\/purshase with a non limited advertising strategy. forgot to add Our FB advertising spending is usually fixed to $13'000 per month and this is due to the volumes of orders we are able to process and communications we are able to respond to. Typical stores spend up to $70'000 per month per FB advertising, so adding more advertising strategies as Google Ads and a better e-mail marketing which can all be set up with a freelancer from upwork fro as little as $50\/month, will easily hike the revenue to minimum $1 million.\nHowever we will be including a 3 months full support from myself and my VA to helping you and guiding you to the process in case you want to, even though we would prefer if we help you set up with a warehouse then you can rest assured as everything is automated except coming up with new items and so one which can be done by hiring any staff"],["Do you have recurring customers?\nYes\nWhy are you selling the business?\nWe are selling the business due to personal reasons, nothing having to do with the business. First reason is that I am relocating as we are moving to Asia and will be starting a physical Fintech business by funds generated from this brands profit.

A great opportunity to grow a true organic business without stress of inventory that sells high quality products rather than low quality drop-shipped products."],["Included in the sale is the company's Instagram account, @sugarhousesupply, which has grown to 23,750 followers with excellent engagement. We have never spent any money on advertising and continue to generate sales solely through its branding, instagram, word of mouth, and our customers user generated content that they post on instagram."],["Also included in the sale is our Etsy Shop \"Headed Somewhere\" where we sell the digital file of our art prints.

Unfortunaley over the last year, we have not had the time to dedicate to the business and have not been promoting it through @Marylauren's account nor any other means. We have just been posting user generated content to the Sugarhouse Supply instagram feed here and there which is still generating sales, so there is a lot of opportunity for someone to really grow this store with additional facebook\/instagram ads, influencer collaborations, giveaways, etc. We have a list of influencer's that are interested in working with us for product trade(another benefit of this store, many influencers love our products and will post for nothing more than product trade). None of the which we have been able to set up or do due to lack of time."],["Business Model:\nSugarhouse Supply is a curation of products made by small artisans, artwork made by @marylauren and various photographers, and some products chosen by us. Included in the sale will be all the products currently listed on the site and about $7,000 worth of inventory. The idea behind our business was to make a curation of really great products that are developed by other small businesses(creators). So many of our products are made and fulfilled(dropshipped) by the creator. We then pay them the order value less our commission which typically ranges from 20%-50%. All of these relationships will transfer to the new owner. We also work with a couple manufacturers that we buy product in small batches from, sell and ship ourselves. These contacts will also be transferred."],["One of the greatest benefits of buying this business with this model is when you want to add new products you will be able to find products you love and then reach out to those new vendors through Etsy, Instagram, Pintrest or wherever you find them., and offer them the oportunity to have their products sold on Sugarhouse Supply. When vendors see the website, branding, and instagram following it will give you instant credibility and it is a very high chance that they will want to work with you. It is so great to be able to sell high quality products without having to hold all the inventory. And so much better than using Oberlo or dropshipping poorly made overseas product! We also have a great connection in San Diego to sell awesome made in LA mid century furniture that we have not had a chance to set up with yet. This contact would also be included."],["Lastly, the most lucrative portion of the business is our artwork. We use [REDACTED] and have a partnership with Framebridge who fulfills these orders for us. It is extremely streamlined. We spend no more than 5 hours a week on this business. It is very automated and easy to run. Which will allow you to have plenty of time to spend on growing it."],["It is such a fun business and it is great to work and support all these other small businesses, which customers also love and appreciate and love to buy from.

Squishies are truly the ideal mail order product. They have an indefinite shelf life, can't be damaged in the mail and weigh just a few ounces!\nThe company launched on Black Friday of 2016 after learning about the trend through our young daughter. I noticed a demand for an honest and reliable US-based squishy shop, and the idea was validated with an instant stream of traffic.\nThe popularity of slow rising squishies has since skyrocketed. Google Trends has tracked a 242% increase for this query in the last 18 months. Despite this explosion, it remains difficult to find reliable distributors and it takes time to gain access to the high-demand premium brands. My suppliers have been thoroughly vetted, are responsive and prompt. I receive early updates of upcoming releases and enjoy discounts as a frequent buyer because of these strong relationships.\n[PRIVATE INFO] visitors break down into three basic groups:\n1) Children and teens, mostly girls, in the U.S.\n2) Adults buying gifts for children and teens\n3) Wholesale customers buying in bulk (brick and mortar retailers in the U.S. and Canada)\nOrganic traffic from Google searches and returning customers make up the lion's share of the visitors (averaging more than 17,000\/month). Social media accounts are established, Instagram and YouTube being the most active. Note that sales increased 174% during the months of November and December.\nThe current model is to drop ship wholesale orders but to ship retail orders from inventory stocked at my location in the US. It would however be easy to return to a drop ship only model. Existing inventory has a retail value of about $9,500 including about 100 unique products with live listings. This inventory is included in the sale of the business and will be shipped to the new owner.\nI recently had a baby and, while it is an ideal business to run from home, it is hard for me to grow the company as a new mom. The website generates great traffic as is and requires only minor maintenance. The squishy trend continues to grow, and there are many new avenues to explore. With our loyal customer base and dependable suppliers [PRIVATE INFO] is a solid and proven enterprise with a promising future."],["Check your email periodically and Private seller should get back to you shortly.

Our products are made by socially responsible companies, artisans and manufacturers that care about the environments and communities in which they produce. We are committed to promoting the stewardship of our Oceans while offering affordable luxury that is uniquely 'Coastal' and 'Atlantic' in style."],["Concept and Implementation:\nFounder & CEO Karen Mackay started with an idea and a full-time commitment in the Summer 2015. Having produced catalogs for a major US & International Catalog retailer early in her career, then working with her own Interior Design firm, as a Real Estate Agent and in Product Sales for years, Mackay was determined to create an online retail \u2018lifestyle\u2019 business. Seeing a real opportunity in the niche of \u2018Coastal\u2019 living she imagined a \u2018Coastal Lifestyle\u2019 brand that would feature both Clothing + Home Decor influenced by both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Being a dual citizen of the USA and Ireland (where she earned her MBA), she determined that Dublin with its strong tech industry, was the best place to formulate the concept and development of just such a company brand.\nBased on the experiences of many years of travel and with design influences from both sides of the Atlantic, Mackay wanted that unique combination of International style and \u2018Coastal\u2019 branding. It began with hiring one of Brown Thomas\u2019 top Irish graphic designers to help develop a brand name and logo that had both a purposeful European, Natural & Coastal \u2018feel\u2019. In hiring a web creation team in Ireland and using Shopify as the online store platform, Mackay was able to develop something both Coastal and International in influence, balanced with a practical and economical approach.\nTwo and a half years from ideation, brand creation, website development and product\/vendor selection to Corporate, Legal and Logistical operations being set up in Florida. Launching the website in late 2016 and releasing WA\u2019s first catalog in May 2017. In partnering with C&G Media Group in the Spring\/Summer 2017, WA\u2019s first print and digital ads were featured. Thus began the process of pitching the Wild Atlantique brand as \u2018designs for living beautifully and affordable luxury combined\u2019 to its niche market. \nWild Atlantique now has 9,100+ followers on it's Facebook page and over 930 email subscribers. It has established complimentary Social Media sites on Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and Linkedin, which are positioned to further expand and grow sales for the business more effectively by someone who is Social Media savy and who can capitalize on the Facebook following with more effective advertising."],["Sales were slow to start at the inception of the business but by establishing Amazon Seller Accounts for the US, Canada, Mexico, UK, Germany, Spain, France, and Italy we have recently seen a marked increase in sales since September 2017 and are we getting more sales through our Facebook advertising which we have been concentrating on specifically for the last 6 months. \nWith her own personal investment of capital for set up, marketing and the purchase of current stock etc, as well as, two and a half years of full time management and fostering, Mackay is determined to find someone to take over the brand and website and grow it using a more specific approach to Social Media use while she focuses on product development."],["Process & Investment to Date:\nBrand and Logo Creation\nWebsite Development & Publishing\nMarketing Brochure Development & Production\nTrade Shows, Establishing Vendor Relationships and Product Offering Development\nIncorporated in West Palm Beach, Florida in Nov. 2015\nCorporate, Legal, Insurance and Tax Set up & Management in Florida\nInitial and continuing Vendor and Product selection; Purchase, Import & Inventory Management\nInitial Shipping Inventory & Logistics Set Up - Delray Beach, Florida\nStaff Hiring and Training\nSEO and Social Media Initiation\nConsultant selection and management of processes, recent work with Marketing and SEO\/SM Consultants to define and achieve a more consistent message for the WA brand online and establishign a plan for moving forward\nLogistical Improvements of Processes\nContact with Oxford Industries (May-July 2017)\nBrand Development and Researching Future Avenues for Growth (Xpert June -July 2017)\nOutsourcing of SM\/SEO (Milk Bottle Labs - Sept 2017 through January 2018)\nSelf Branding - Consult and focus for Future to be a separate business venture of Karen Mackay.\nPersonal Shareholder Funding of all operations in excess of $240,000 to date - Karen Mackay"],["Check your email periodically and Wild A. should get back to you shortly.

Price slightly negotiable.\nI started this store on November 20 because a friend of mine had an instagram page in this niche with around 800k followers. After a lot of research I discovered that there is a huge passionate market for this specific niche with low competition and a big variety of products. Our initial plan was to market the store on his instagram page and scale it later with facebook ads with lookalike audiences. Unfortunately my partner sold his instagram page and I don't want to continue with this store because it's not really my type of niche, so I want to sell it to someone that will put in the time and work to make huge profits from this. I only did marketing on my partner's instagram page so you can imagine what you can do with e-mail marketing,facebook marketing, instagram influencers etc. There's a lot of potential in this. We only got into jewelry products, bedding sets and a little of home decoration. You can also jump into clothing products, home decoration, statues, crystals, gemstones and a lot of other things. All the products are sourced from Aliexpress with the Oberlo app. The store is operating on a dropshipping model. The amount of hours I put in this was around 1 or 2 hours a day. Since we didn't had to pay for marketing, the profit margins we're around 80%. The highest earnings we had we're on Black Friday-Cyber Monday with $2300 in 3-4 days with only 10 posts on his page. The store has an professional design for smooth and easy customer experience, fast loading times, professional logo and beautiful proven to sell existing products. We only marketed the store for like 3 months and a half, since he sold his page. The sales made after that we're from returning customers because we offered an amazing customer service and experience.\nThe store is highly brandable and has everything you need for you to begin your e-commerce adventure. \nAlso, if you want I can include a course that I bought for $1000 that contains everything you need to know about Facebook Marketing ( I learned everything I know about facebook marketing from it) - Ben Malol Social Marketing Masterclass - the best on the market. \n If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to ask."],["Check your email periodically and Purcaru A. should get back to you shortly.

I had a vision of starting something reasonable priced and fashion forward, that can be worn by everyone for every occasion. Included in the sale of Imperial COLT is all inventory, facebook account, instagram account (which combined have a following of 20,000 people!) All domains, online accounts and passwords as well as our sponsored rider who blogs for us monthly. We have placed numerous marketing campaigns on facebook and instagram that always get a great response, we also have brilliant social media influencers with large followings. We also send out email campaigns when we have news, offers or discounts and those reach a total audience of 393 people. We have a good rate of retuning customers that have all been extremely happy with their purchases.

The reason behind the selling of the company is the lack of time from the management to operate the business, since there is an involvement in other businesses, outside this area."],["The aim of this business is to provide customers with a quick and pleasant shopping experience while having the best prices on the market.

The multiplatform marketing that we have in place is essential for the customer acquisition and loyalty through discounts and other re-engagement strategies."],["Online Market and Motocross"],["The trend of the online sales has come to stay and will increasingly bring the conversion of the traditional physical store to the online one. Online shopping allows the access to a greater transparency, product range, and price security. All this with more convenience and speed, decreasing the need to resort to the physical exploration of the market. The prominent presence of the smartphone is undeniable, and it's now, more than ever, possible to consult and purchase products in an instantaneous way, favoring more purchases by impulse."],["In the Motocross and Off-road market in general, there is precisely the same trend as the global market. The fans of this sport are increasingly looking to buy online, since they have access to an \"infinite\" number of different parts for their motorbikes with the best prices. In addition, they can exchange opinions with other users in the community and look to photos and access the product information, making sure they are making the best possible purchase.\nFrom the seller's perspective, besides being in sync with the future market trend, there is a very important increase in turnover in online, when compared to a physical store. An online store extends its market to the whole country and potentially abroad, while a physical store only consists of the market in the vicinity of its location. \nIn Portugal, this is still a market with much to explore. Online competition is low and with very old-fashioned platforms (no customer service, no payment on delivery, websites that do not work on mobile and with completely outdated programming), ending up failing to get the customer's trust (a very important factor when it comes to online sales). Having said that, it is a market with huge turnover potential.\nIn terms of sport, the off-road market has been growing globally, with more aficionados each year, especially in our country where free driving is still allowed in the woods, unlike most Europe. The clear evidence of the growth of this area is in the number of motorcycles sold each year, which continue to increase, not forgetting the number of new brands appearing in the market."],["Main features and advantages:"],["Statistics"],["Check your email periodically and Pedro A. should get back to you shortly.

I'm surprised at the organic traction this store has gotten- first ranking on Google search, real instagram followers, and organic traffic daily. I know this store can easily and near instantly get back to what it did in the first month, should even exceed those numbers with some advertising. This is a sweet niche and has the most impulsive buyers one could ask for. Selling because I don't have the time or interest in taking attention away from my main stores to boost this little guy. Yellars is a neglected gem and a brand with real potential. I want to pass this to someone rather than letting a good grape dry. Make your offers, if you are just starting out and don't have the capital you can still reach out as I'm considering the possibility of letting someone run this store with profit split"],["Check your email periodically and Sarah C. should get back to you shortly.

The Personal Training Certification is $199 and is valid for 2 years. During those 2 years the trainer must obtain CEC's (Continuing Education Credits) in order to keep their certification active.

This means that as long as this customer continues as a personal trainer they will need to stay certified and to keep it active they will be purchasing ongoing."],["The biggest challenge is marketing to customers. We created this company because we have the expertise to build a comprehensive website as well as the expertise in the fitness industry.

Even if you have a hot-selling item #1, you must not only be able to scale this item up (vertically) but also scale it sideways, meaning you have to find a way to make your buyers to add additional related items (#2, #3, #4, and so on) to their carts- you must know how to increase your AOV (average order value) by up-selling\/ down-selling to the buyer. Your AOV could also be increased by making your buyer want to purchase multiple versions or bundles of same Item (different sizes and colors, for example). To further increase your store revenue, in addition to \u201cfront end\u201d money, you must be able to generate\u201d back end\u201d money, meaning those who has purchase from you today should be compelled to purchase from you again and thus to become your repeat customers. A good Shopify store must have an automated \u201cpost-purchase\u201d email sequence, where various items (#2, #3, #4, and so on) are offered to the email subscribers by automatically emailing them attractive offers with time sensitive special discount, etc. VERY FEW SHOP OWNERS KNOW ABOUT IT AND EVEN LESS IMPLEMENT IT. THIS STORE HAS ALL OF THE ABOVE IN PLACE."],["Over the last two year Grovy Grabz store has been strategically and methodically designed and constantly improved to include all of the above tactics. Hundreds of items have been researched, cherry picked and thoroughly tested before including them into our collection. Each store listing has been created with a goal of increasing the AOV and inviting my first-time customer to become my repeat customer. A number of highly effective up-sell\/ down-sell, coupons, abandoned cart and other apps have been added to Groovy Grabz Shopify store to squeeze out every single penny and to avoid leaving any money on the table."],["I had some amazing result- while our AOV has doubled, and in some cases tripled. More often than before I\u2019re seeing some high ticket order of $60, $80, $100, $150 coming in. I have seen a couple of $300- $600 orders. My record high single order was for 44 items and total amount of $1,041.50! That has confirmed that I\u2019m on the right path and that my hard work to increase AOV has started to yield some serious results."],["Store profitability"],["Our reason to be in business is to make some profit, agree? Those who open a brand-new store will spend a lot of time and money learning and making mistakes that will cost them dearly. Statistics tell us that the vast majority of new stores owner are not profitable and a lot of them quit because they aren\u2019t able to stay profitable. It took me almost a year and around $50K in education, products research and development and advertising testing to find what works and ultimately to make my store profitable. I was lucky, because I have other profitable business, so I could actually afford to invest 50K from that business; it allowed me to stay \u201cafloat\u201d while making it profitable. My goal was 35-35-20-10, where 35% goes into Facebook advertising, 35% into cost of products- it leaves me with 20% of PROFIT. 10% are spent to pay for my Shopify store, Mailchimp and a few other necessary apps. Time in itself is the most perishable and therefore precious asset. So, if you\u2019d like to save a year of your life + 50K of your hard-earn money, get this store that has already proven to make money.

Personally, I have never included any products in our collection that had less that 4.7 out of 5 stars rating on AliExpress. I went even further- every single item you see in my store has been ordered and tested by me prior to adding it to the collection. I\u2019ve coupled it with fast shipping (epacket) and great customer service, for example, answering all buyers emails within 24 hours. I have avoided temptation of making a \u201cquick buck\u201d at our buyers\u2019 expense and it paid off in more than one way. #1 The store has earned its customer TRUST. #2 Out of $129,540 total sales I have refunded only $1,565.87- that\u2019s just above 1%!
